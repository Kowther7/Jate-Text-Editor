# Jate-Text-Editor 


---

The Text Editor PWA Challenge was developed to explore Progressive Web Application construction, primarily centered around crafting a versatile text editor. It aimed to thoroughly investigate PWA functionalities and their practical implementation.

**User Objective:**
For developers seeking a reliable tool, the objective was to facilitate the creation and storage of notes or code snippets, accessible with or without an internet connection.

**Key Expectations:**
- Visualization of a client-server folder structure upon application launch.
- Initialization of the backend and client server via `npm run start`.
- Bundling JavaScript files using webpack.
- Generation of essential files (HTML, service worker, manifest) through webpack plugins.
- Ensuring compatibility with advanced JavaScript without compromising functionality.
- Immediate setup of IndexedDB for seamless content storage.
- Automatic content saving in the text editor upon leaving the window.
- Retrieval of stored content upon reopening the text editor.
- Streamlined app installation as a desktop icon with an "Install" button.
- Efficient caching of static assets via Workbox and service worker registration.
- Implementation of proper build scripts for a webpack application on Heroku deployment.

**Tools and Frameworks Used:**
The project utilized the `idb` database.

**Installation Steps:**
